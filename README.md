Source for the game Die Hennerin.

For the source I used the Godot 3.4 documentation. In there is a small example project named Dodge the Creeps. 
I followed the manual and changed some stuff in it, because I think the game is more individual like this and, to be honest, it's a lot of more fun. It contains a doggo now.
